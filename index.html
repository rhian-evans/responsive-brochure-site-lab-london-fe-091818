          <p>At a first glance, Melbourne seems less tourist friendly than the other major Australian cities. Its lack of iconic landmarks and strikingly beautiful beaches means that it is often overlooked by overseas visitors. However, Melbourne’s strengths are found in its rich cultural scene with live music, an array of sports, impressive art galleries and phenomenal quality food and coffee on offer.
          </p> 

          <p>The city is split in two by the Yarra River. The suburbs North of the river attract a hipster crowd whereas many of the suburbs South of the river are populated by Melbourne’s elite. Whilst staying in Melbourne, it is certainly worth checking out both to fully understand the many facets of the Melbourne identity.
          </p>
          
          <p>Melbourne has been voted the most livable city in the world for a record breaking seven years in a row (between 2011-2017) so there is no limit the amount of time that you could spend exploring the area.
          </p>

          <p>Moreover, if you hire a car, Melbourne is flanked by the beautiful beaches and wineries of the Mornington Peninsula on one side and the impressive views and spectacular drive of the Great Ocean Road on the other.
